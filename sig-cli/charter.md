# SIG CLI Charter

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Kubernetes Charter README] and uses
the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance].

## Scope

The Command Line Interface SIG (SIG CLI) is responsible for kubectl and
related tools. This group focuses on general purpose command line tools and
libraries to interface with Kubernetes API's.

### In scope

SIG CLI [README]

#### Code, Binaries and Services

SIG CLI code include general purpose command line tools and binaries for working
with Kubernetes API's. Examples of these binaries include: [kubectl and kustomize].

### Out of scope

SIG CLI is not responsible for command-line tools built and maintained by other
SIGs, such as kubeadm, which is owned by SIG Cluster Lifecycle. SIG CLI is not
responsible for defining the Kubernetes API that it interfaces with. The
Kubernetes API is the responsibility of SIG API Machinery.

## Roles and Organization Management

SIG CLI adheres to the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance]
and opts-in to updates and modifications to [sig-governance].

### Deviations from [sig-governance]

- In addition to Technical Leads, SIG CLI defines Emeritus Leads. These former
  SIG CLI leaders *SHOULD* be available to provide historical perspective and
  domain knowledge.
- SIG CLI defines the role of Test Health Maintainer. Contributors who have
  successfully completed one test on-call rotation within the last six months as
  shown in the test on-call schedule of the [Test Playbook] are included in this
  group. Test Health Maintainers are SIG CLI Members.

### Subproject Creation

Option 1: by [SIG Technical Leads](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/committee-steering/governance/sig-governance.md#tech-lead)
